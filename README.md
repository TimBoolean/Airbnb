                                                              Intro

This was a learning project to understand the prominent bookings within the four cities in California: Big Bear City, Big Bear Lake,  Joshua Tree, and Yucca Valley. In addition, I was looking at revenue by months pulled by the cities and the percentage of host types that existed in each city.


                                                              Goal
The goal of this project was to answer which host type a person should be more engaged in if there's sole goal is to generate revenue. Different kind of host type dominates in each city, and it's in the best interest of the host to accomadate based on the volume of bookings.
